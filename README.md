# Spell Checker Application

This spell checker application utilizes a Trie data structure to efficiently check the spelling of words and provide suggestions for corrections. It's written in Python and offers a simple interface for spell checking.

## Trie Data Structure

The application uses a Trie, a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings. Each node in the Trie represents a single character of a string, and the strings themselves are stored in a sequence of nodes connected by edges.

- **Efficient Searching**: The Trie allows for fast search, insert, and delete operations on strings.
- **Space Optimization**: It uses less space compared to other data structures like hash tables, as common prefixes of strings are shared.
- **Spell Checking and Suggestions**: The Trie is ideal for spell checking as it can quickly retrieve all words that share a common prefix, which is useful for generating spelling suggestions.

## Features

- **Spell Checking**: Checks if a word is spelled correctly.
- **Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for misspelled words.
- **Add and Remove Words**: Ability to add and remove words from the spell checker's dictionary.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you'll need Python installed on your machine. The application has been tested with Python 3.x.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone [URL to your repository]
2. **Navigate to the Application Directory**:
cd [Application Directory]
3. **Load the Dictionary**:
- Place your dictionary file named `words` in the application directory. This file should contain a list of words, one per line.
4. **Run the Application**:
python [Name of your main application file]
5. **Use the Interface**:
- The application will prompt you to enter words for spell checking and will display if the word is spelled correctly or not.
- If a word is misspelled, it will provide suggestions for correct spelling.
